# Antiferromagnetic Josephson Junctions and Spin-Triplet Current Formation

## Abstract
This project investigates the fabrication and analysis of superconducting-ferromagnetic-superconducting (SFS) Josephson junctions with antiferromagnetic chromium (Cr) spacers. The study compares structures with and without copper (Cu) layers to explore the role of spin-triplet Cooper pairs in enabling non-dissipative spin currents for superconducting spintronics. Experimental results reveal symmetric phase shifts in critical current under magnetic fields, unresolved magnetization dynamics in Cr/Fe layers, and the mitigating effect of Cu spacers on spin-orbit coupling suppression.

## Key Features
- **Two Junction Groups**:  
  - **Group A**: Includes Cu layers encapsulating Cr (`Nb/Cu/Cr/Fe/Cr/Cu/Nb`).  
  - **Group B**: No Cu layers (`Nb/Cr/Fe/Cr/Nb`).  
- **Fabrication Methods**: Photolithography, sputtering (Nb, Al, Fe, Cr, Au), ion milling, and e-beam lithography.  
- **Measurements**:  
  - SQUID-based critical current (\(I_c\)) vs. magnetic flux (\(\Phi\)) at 4.2 K.  
  - Fraunhofer patterns modeled using Bessel functions for elliptical junctions.  
- **Key Observations**:  
  - Symmetric phase shift in \(I_c\) during field sweeps.  
  - Absence of critical current suppression in upper sweeps (unresolved magnetization dynamics).  
  - Cu spacers enhance triplet coherence by reducing direct coupling to Nb.  

## Methodology
### Fabrication
- **Substrate**: Silicon wafer with Nb/Al base electrodes.  
- **Sputtering**: Sequential deposition of superconducting (Nb), ferromagnetic (Fe), and antiferromagnetic (Cr) layers.  
- **Lithography**: Photolithography for patterning and e-beam lithography for fine features.  
- **Ion Milling**: Etching to define junctions and isolate electrodes.  

### Measurement
- **SQUID Setup**: Custom cryogenic system for \(I_c\)-\(\Phi\) dependence.  
- **Fraunhofer Analysis**: Airy function modeling for elliptical junctions.  

## Results
- **Critical Current Behavior**:  
  - Symmetric phase shifts indicate spin-triplet dominance.  
  - Lack of suppression in upper sweeps suggests spin-glass interfacial dynamics.  
- **Cu Layer Impact**:  
  - Group A (with Cu) shows larger \(I_c\) and preserved triplet coherence.  
  - Group B (without Cu) exhibits suppressed \(I_c\) due to spin-orbit coupling.  

## Conclusion
The study demonstrates unconventional spin-rotation at F/AF/S interfaces, highlighting the potential of spin-triplet currents for superconducting spintronics. Future work could explore domain-resolved magnetization measurements and atomistic modeling of interfacial dynamics.
